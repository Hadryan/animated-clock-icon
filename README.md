Easy-to-use animated clock icon written in Kotlin

![](https://github.com/alxrm/Timecon/blob/master/imgs/timecon.gif?raw=true)


## Including in your project

Add to your root build.gradle:
```Groovy
allprojects {
	repositories {
	    // ...
	    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	}
}
```

Add the dependency:
```Groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.alxrm:animated-clock-icon:1.0.2'
}
```

Usage
-----

### ClockDrawable

You can use it as a `Drawable`, and insert into any `ImageView`,
with beautiful fluent API like this:

```Java
final ImageView clocks = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.clocks); // some ImageView
final ClockDrawable clockDrawable = ClockDrawable.builder(this)
    .hours(4)                                                   // initial time hours
    .minutes(20)                                                // initial time minutes
    .withSpeed(-2.5F)                                           // set indeterminate animation minutes pointer speed (1F by default)
    .withColor(Color.WHITE)                                     // set icon color
    .withFrameWidth(Stroke.REGULAR)                             // set frame width
    .withPointerWidth(Stroke.THIN)                              // set pointer width
    .withDuration(600L)                                         // set animation duration in millis (600L by default)
    .withInterpolator(new DecelerateInterpolator())             // set animation interpolator (default is OverShootInterpolator)
    .withListener(new AnimatorListenerAdapter() {/*...*/})      // set animation listener
    .into(clocks);                                              // attach the Drawable you built to ImageView and returns Drawable
 // .build();                                                      or you can just use build() to simply get Drawable   
```

All of these methods can be ignored, so the drawable will be created with it's default state

### ClockImageView

There is an `ImageView` wrapper that simply draws the icon and provides an API to work with it.
You can use it in any layout.

Customization is also available through xml attributes:

```xml
	<rm.com.clocks.ClockImageView
		android:id="@+id/clocks"
		android:layout_width="56dp"
		android:layout_height="56dp"
		android:layout_centerInParent="true"
		app:hours="16"
		app:minutes="20"
		app:timeSetDuration="400"
		app:clockColor="#BBFFFFFF"
		app:indeterminateSpeed="2"
		app:pointerWidth="thin"
		app:frameWidth="regular"
		/>
```

## API

To set hours and minutes on the clocks without animation:

```java
Clock.setHours(int hours)
Clock.setMinutes(int minutes)
```

To change time _with_ animation:

```java
Clock.animateToTime(int hours, int minutes)
```

To make it spinning endlessly:

```java
Clock.animateIndeterminate()
```

Use `stop()` to interrupt this indeterminate animation

If you want it to __"tick"__ endlessly, set `indeterminateSpeed` to `0.001F`

Or if you want it to show a __rewind__ like animation, set negative `indeterminateSpeed`

## Contribution

I'd like to improve this, so feel free to suggest your ideas about it in the issues,
or, if you found a bug and you have some free time to fix it, writing a few lines of code in __Kotlin__, 
feel free to send me PRs.
